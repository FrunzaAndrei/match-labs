# Week3 assignment

In this assignment we create a form which will be used to register and to edit an existing candidate.
Please check the root folder and inside the `/lab-resources` folder you will find 2 images showcasing a preview of the final work.

The form component will have to accept an object as an `inputs={inputsData}` prop. From this object, the form will have to build its own input fields.
You can find the local mock objects in the mocks.js file.

The form should be a separate component called `<CandidateForm>` which will reside once in the `Account` page, and once in the `Register` page. We need to create those pages and add `routes` to them. Make sure to include the apropriate `CandidateForm.module.css`, `Register.module.css`, and `Account.module.css`

For each input of the form, we should have the possibility to display a default value, or a placeholder. The reason for this is that in our app we need to display the inputs with the default value on the "Edit account" page, while on the "Create candidate" page we will display the inputs that have a placeholder value.

The form will need to have a submit button, that when clicked, will pass all the data of the form, to the parent component, which in our case is the `Account` page.

As a final step, in the `Account` page `console.log()` the received values of the form.
